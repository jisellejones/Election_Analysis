#Congratulations! You’ve helped Seth and Tom submit the election audit results to the election commission. But wait! The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:

#The voter turnout for each county
#The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
#The county with the highest turnout

#Working from this module’s election_results.csv file, use for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. Then, print the results to the command line and save them to your election_results.txt file.
# Deliverables
    # Deliverable 1: The Election Results Printed to the Command Line
    # Deliverable 2: The Election Results Saved to a Text File
    # Deliverable 3: A written Analysis of the Election Audit (README.md)
